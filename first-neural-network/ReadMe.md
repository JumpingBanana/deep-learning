# First Neural Network
Goal of this project is to build a simple neural network to predict bike sharing usage on given day.

The network build in this project consisted of 3 inputs node, single hidden layer with 20 nodes ,and 1 output node in output layer. Activation function used in hidden layer is Sigmoid function and use linear function f(x) = x as an activation funtion in output layer.
